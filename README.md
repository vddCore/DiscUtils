### The "what"
This is a fork of DiscUtils.  

### The "why;tldr?"
I just wanted NTFS to work on .NET Core Linux platform.   

### The "why don't you PR this into upstream you ungrateful fuck"
Feel free to do that yourself. I just duct-taped Mono project's System.Security stuff into this. It's not rocket science. Good luck getting that PR merged though.  

### The "why did you throw the entire project out"
I ain't gonna need all those other 47 projects.  

### The "why did you make it namespace-incompatbile reeeeeeeeee"
Just exercising muh freedoms, UwU.  

### Umad?
Kinda. Yeah.  

### Thanks to...
...creators of DiscUtils for... well... DiscUtils, I guess.  
...to Mono project for providing necessary Windows security classes - those are located in DiscUtils.Core.WindowsSecurity.
